# nemo0622's pokeemerald Decompilation BASE Project

## What is this?

This repository is designed to act as an "ideal" base for Pokémon Emerald Rom
Hacking. There are dozens of amazing branches out there, but many are tedious or
borderline impossible to merge, so this will hopefully remove a lot of that work.

## What is included in this pokeemerald decompilation?

Note: All credit for this base goes to these creators!! I just did the merging and made some fixes, please support and thank the people below:
- [RHH's pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion):
    - Fairy Type
    - Physical/Special Split
    - Data for all Pokémon up to Generation 8 (including Hisuian Forms!)
    - Much, MUCH more! Please check pokeemerald-expansion itself for all details/documentation
- [aarant's branches](https://github.com/aarant/pokeemerald):
    - Following Pokémon in the overworld! Currently supports all Pokémon from Generations 1-3, with other Pokémon currently showing as invisible.
    - Lighting! Day/Night system, shadows under all NPCs, and shining lamp posts.
    - Key item wheel, allowing up to 4 items to be registered.

## Known Issues & Future of this project

- Most Pokémon with multiple forms only support a single form in the overworld
    - Ex: All rotom forms only show default rotom, all Burmy forms appear green, etc.
- "Large" Pokémon sprites are currently not supported
    - Pokémon such as Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, and Arceus cannot follow you

As of right now, I plan to continue adding more following Pokémon sprites over time. I will also make a few minor changes which will be added to the list above.
